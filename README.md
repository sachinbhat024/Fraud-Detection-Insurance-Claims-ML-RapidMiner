A legal firm known by the name DAX compensation lawyers has been facing a critical issue in the insurance sector. 
Identification of fraudulent claims is what we are looking at. A lot of claimants make ill use of the system’s claiming 
procedure by presenting fraudulent personal injury claims. These are serious challenges that lead to extreme financial 
losses for the company while also putting the genuine claimants under suspicion.

Executive Problem Statement:

The firm has been tackling high and an increasing number of fraudulent claims under the category of personal injury 
insurance. Such fraudulent exist within the data of above 3000 claims which the firm has provided us with. Non-genuine 
claimants constantly aim to exploit the firm’s claiming procedure by intentionally submitting claims with non-existent, 
unrelated, and exaggerated injuries in order to get a hold of non-deserving compensations. This is resulting in financial 
losses to the firm while also putting the genuine claimants holding the policies under the suspicious eye thereby 
questioning the whole system of insurance claims.  
Based on the data presented to us, we are to provide the firm with an effective method enabling them to identify and 
inspect potential frauds in the future thereby protecting the rights of genuine claimants. We are also aiming at minimising 
the firm’s financial losses and keeping our client’s best interests in consideration, we want to assist them in practicing 
their business ethically. The data provided to us by DAX compensation lawyers can be utilised well to assist them with 
the issues they are facing. 

Executive Solution Statement:

After examining various aspects of the claims, it is noticeable that quite a few factors are correlated. We have included 
visualisations for some of those factors in this report. While exploring the data using visualisations and careful inspection, 
it was noticed that fraudulent claims are more likely to occur where the claimants have mentioned: the cause of injury 
(Figure 2) as struck object, lifting and slip/fall, nature of injury (Figure 3) as contusion and sprain/strain, their marital 
status as married and widowed, injured body parts as back and head. Such frauds are also likely to occur among the 
claimants: between the age group of 30-40 years, who had no witness present (Figure 1) at the time of incident, and 
who reported that motor vehicles were not involved in the incident. 
Out of all the approaches tried and tested thoroughly during the process, we would recommend the kNN modelling 
approach with its value = 5 (Figure 12) to DAX Compensation Lawyers. After following our recommendations, they would 
be able to make better predictions while identifying genuine or fraudulent claimants in the future. This would allow the firm 
to significantly reduce their financial losses while streamlining the claiming process. Genuine claimants’ faith would be 
restored in the firm and eventually the industry. The customers would be happy and satisfied with the firm’s fast decision
making process. The firm would get recognised even better in the sector. This would eventually generate more customers 
and revenue.
